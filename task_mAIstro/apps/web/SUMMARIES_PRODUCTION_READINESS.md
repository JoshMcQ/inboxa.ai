## ðŸš¨ Known Limitations & Mitigations

### Rate Limiting
**Limitation:** LLM API rate limits could affect large batches
**Mitigation:**
- Chunked processing (5 threads/chunk)
- Automatic retry logic in place
- Graceful degradation with fallback summaries

### Cache Dependencies
**Limitation:** Redis outages affect performance (not functionality)
**Mitigation:**
- Cache failures don't break core functionality
- Automatic fallback to direct LLM calls
- Error logging for monitoring

### Thread Content Size
**Limitation:** Very large emails might hit LLM context limits
**Mitigation:**
- Content truncation to 2000 chars per message
- Last 5 messages only processed
- Fallback to subject line if content unavailable

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- **API response times** (target: <8s for 10 threads)
- **Cache hit ratio** (target: >70%)
- **LLM success rate** (target: >95%)
- **Error rates** (target: <1%)
- **User engagement** (filter usage, regeneration frequency)

### Alerting Thresholds
- ðŸ”´ **Critical:** API response time >15s
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning:** Cache hit ratio <50%
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning:** LLM error rate >5%
- ðŸ”´ **Critical:** Redis connection failures

### Health Checks
